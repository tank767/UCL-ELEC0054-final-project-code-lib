To whom it may concern:
The MATLAB codes in that project include estimating the symbol error rate (SER) in an optical fibre link using the modulation formats M-PSK and M-QAM, plotting the SER curve varying with span number, M, launch power, and beta2(GVD). This is the support document for the project Ultra-wideband optical fibre transmission systems submitted in 2025
